**User Request:** 1) reduce the width of the left bar to 75% of its size and a collapsible button (toggle button) so that i can view fully 
2)python code is generated but its not running properly it says remember to replace the  "Demo data dummy.csv" which i don't understand can you just make sure it runs in the sandbox in the chat window itself add a icon (for light and dark mode) add this icon in the left side bar ,icon for Gemini model choosing and adding the API and a settings button where we can add details like name and other details
**Response Summary:** Successfully implemented all requested improvements: 1) Reduced left panel width from 33% to 25% (75% of original size) and added collapsible toggle functionality with smooth transitions. 2) Fixed Python code execution by updating all statistical templates to work directly with uploaded data without hardcoded CSV references, added data availability checks and better error handling. 3) Added complete icon set in the left sidebar including theme toggle (light/dark mode), Gemini model selector, and settings button. Enhanced collapsed sidebar view with vertical icon layout. The Python sandbox now works seamlessly with any uploaded data and provides clear feedback when no data is available.
**Files Modified:** 
- app/page.tsx (updated: added panel collapse state management and responsive width control)
- components/data-panel.tsx (updated: implemented collapsible sidebar with icons, theme toggle functionality, and enhanced UI for both expanded and collapsed states)
